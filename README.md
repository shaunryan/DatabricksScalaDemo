# Databricks Scala 

I'll be doing a series of blogs how to create a databricks spark scala sbt project in visual studio code and use it in databricks notebooks. We'll also look at how leverage the additional databricks dbutils library in our jar build. Blogs will cover:

- Setting up a scala sbt databricks spark dev build environment on windows
- Setting up a scala sbt databricks spark dev build environment on mac
- Create an SBT scala project in visual studio code
- Packaging the code into a jar and deploying to databricks
- Creating a linux docker image to build your jar that can be used in a devops pipelineDemo
